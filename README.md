ReCripcha asks captchas that can only be solved correctly with a disabled perspective to keep ableist scum off your website. It was inspired by getting recaptchas that asked me to select stairs in photos which, as someone with physical mobility limitations, Iâ€™m constantly avoiding. It serves up three ReCripchas at the moment. I built this to learn Vue before starting with CACI in 2022. I also wanted to play with more CSS things like Bulma and CSS animations.
